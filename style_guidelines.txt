Overall Look and Feel of the website
===============================
We want to demonstrate the features of the ThermoMug on the website, like the ability to change the tempature so easily.
Images will have a basic 'pop-up' animation. And there will be a static menu bar on the side with important links.

Colours
========
The colours will be the hot (red-ish) and the cold (blue-ish) and everything in between.
General colours:
- 61, 61, 255
- 69, 69, 255
- 119, 221, 255
- 255, 255, 255
- 252, 252, 103
- 255, 192, 76
- 250, 44, 44

Iconography
===========
We will focus on using icons that have a 'flat' design, which adheres to the
overall look and feel.

Links

All links will be found in a button that slightly change colour when the user hovers over it.

Buttons

Overall Look and Feel of the website
===============================
We want to demonstrate the features of the ThermoMug on the website, like the ability to change the tempature so easily.
Images will have a small 'pop-up' animation with a drop down shadow to give the website a feel in interactivity.
And there will be a static menu bar on the side with important links that will be decorated like a thermostat.

Colours
========
The colours will be the hot (red-ish) and the cold (blue-ish) and everything in between.
General colours (in RGB):
- 61, 61, 255
- 69, 69, 255
- 119, 221, 255
- 255, 255, 255
- 252, 252, 103
- 255, 192, 76
- 250, 44, 44

Iconography
===========
We will use icons to show the mug features, and have concept
art as temporary replacements to the actual product image.

Typography
==========
The font that will be used is Trebuchet MS.

Links
=====
All links will be found in a button that slightly change colour when the user hovers over it.

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat design with a grey-ish colour to make it stand out.

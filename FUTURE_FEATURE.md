Features that would've been nice to have, but didn't have time to be done:
- An 'alert()' waring that unsaved progress will be lost if you leave
- A function that can check whether you are already logged in and won't ask you again everytime.
- An option to save an account so when you relogin you can see your saved progress.
- Make the background animation more obvious my setting it with the user's scrolling position.
- Show what is in the shopping cart, instead of just a number.
- Actually build the payment system. (I think it would be hard, but would be cool)

    <p>Designed to be used by kids, the ThermoMug for Kids does more than keep your drink hot. Our smart mugs for kids allow you to set the exact temperature of your drink and keep it hot for a long time. If your drink is too hot, you can set it to a cooler temperature. If your drink is too cold, you can set it to a higher temperature. Your drink will never be too hot or too cold for your child.</p>
    <p>The Kids ThermoMug is easy to clean and can be washed by hand. It is very difficult to break because it is made of plastic and rubber, safe materials for children. The mug lid is dishwasher safe. </p>
